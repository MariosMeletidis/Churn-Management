Churn Management Project

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling customer churn data to develop effective retention strategies. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), churn risk prediction, and responsiveness modeling, leveraging machine learning techniques for actionable insights.


Notebooks

1. Responsiveness Modeling (ResponsivenessPrediction.ipynb)

	•	Focuses on predicting customer responsiveness to retention offers using machine learning models.
	•	Identifies customers likely to engage with targeted interventions.

2. Churn Analysis (ChurnManagement.ipynb)

	•	Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key churn drivers.
	•	Implements churn risk prediction models to classify high-risk customers.
	•	Provides insights to optimize retention strategies.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.8 or higher
	•	Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt using:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Getting Started

	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/MariosMeletidis/Churn-Management.git
cd churn-management


	2.	Open the notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code) and run the cells to execute the analysis.

Key Highlights

	•	EDA: Visualizes trends and patterns in churn data.
	•	Churn Risk Prediction: Employs machine learning models to identify high-risk customers.
	•	Responsiveness Modeling: Targets customers most likely to respond positively to retention efforts.

Next Steps

	•	Integrate real-time responsiveness predictions into customer retention workflows.
	•	Extend the analysis to include additional features or datasets.
